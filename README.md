🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python 3
Pygame library
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Sprite groups & collision detection

🧠 Game Mechanics:
Enemies fall from the top of the screen.
Destroy enemies to gain +10 score.
If enemies reach the bottom, you lose health.
If enemies collide with you, you lose more health.
The game ends when health reaches 0.
Difficulty increases every 100 points.

This project demonstrates:
Game loop structure
Sprite-based game design
Collision handling
Dynamic difficulty scaling
Clean class-based architecture in Pygame
